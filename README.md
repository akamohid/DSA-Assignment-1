# ðŸ“š DSA Assignment â€“ CPU Scheduler & 1024-bit Number Generator

This repository contains two tasks implemented in C++ as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Task 1: Round-Robin CPU Scheduler

A simulation of a round-robin CPU scheduling algorithm using a circular linked list. The scheduler distributes CPU time among processes in fixed time slices until all are completed.

- Each process has a unique ID and required execution time.
- CPU gives a time slice of 3 units per cycle.
- Completed processes are removed from the cycle.

### Features:
- Circular singly linked list
- Dynamic process addition/removal
- Real-time process completion tracking

## ðŸ”¢ Task 2: 1024-bit Number Generator with Primality Test

A generator for a 1024-bit number using a singly linked list, followed by a simple XOR-based primality check.

- Generates 16 random 64-bit segments to form a 1024-bit number.
- Uses XOR to combine segments and apply a lightweight odd-check for primality (simulated check).

### Features:
- Linked list-based large number representation
- Random number segment generation
- Simple primality probability test
